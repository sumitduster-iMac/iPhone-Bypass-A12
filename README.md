Fully Open Source A12+ Bypass

Brought to you By: @rhcp011235 / @rust_505 / @Matty_Inc (For sending me a bash version that i could use to help make this)

Special Thanks to @rust_505 for fixing up the last 30% or so of the code, I did not have a test device and did as best i could without one!

How to for OSX (Mac) (Tested) and Linux (Untested but should be the same as mac)

Initial Setup

Server Configuration:

Get your computer's network IP address

ipconfig getifaddr en1
ifconfig works too

Start the server (replace x.x.x.x with your actual IP)
cd server/
php -S x.x.x.x:8000 -t public

2. File Configuration:

Open downloads.28.png in a text editor

Find and replace all paths to badfile.plist with your server IP

Example: http://192.168.0.103:8000/badfile.plist

Activation Process (3 Stages)
Stage 1 - Initial Activation:

The generator program automatically sends downloads.28.sqlitedb

The device will reboot after this stage

Important: Periodically delete downloads.28.sqlitedb-shm and downloads.28.sqlitedb-val files in the downloads folder before reboot

Stage 2 - Metadata Transfer:

After first reboot, the server creates iTunesMetadata.plist

Manually copy this file to /var/mobile/Media/Books/ folder

Reboot iPhone - asset.epub will appear after this

Stage 3 - Data Population:

Server receives requests like: 192.168.0.105:52588 [200]: GET /firststp/8dc56bf27aa8b527/fixedfile

The asset.epub book gets populated with data from these requests

Do not stop the server until the process fully completes!

💡 Important Notes
GUID for Generation:

Get it manually from: https://hanakim3945.github.io/posts/download28_sbx_escape/

Critical Reminders:

✅ Server must run continuously until the final reboot

✅ Don't interrupt the process after launching activator.py

✅ Monitor server logs to track progress

✅ Keep the server active throughout all stages
